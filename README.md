## Running the Solutions
To run the solutions, navigate to the specific year's folder and run `make`.
Other targets are available, such as `make test` to run all tests, or `make 1` to run a specific day.

Input files for each day are not included in this repository.
To automatically download the input files, you need to set the `AOC_COOKIE` variable in `tools/.env`, then run `make input`.
Alternatively, you can manually download the input files and place them in the `input` folder.
